- moved to many-tab nip2

13/3/13
- started vilcalib.ws

12/3/13
- uvlcalib.ws now does full KM


Changes
-------

v6
==

- oops, uvlumcalib assumed stray lights was white

- mark spectralon on flourescece image, not visible

- first version of KM 

v5
==

- uvlumcalib3.ws shows the synthetic stray light image it makes

- fix a spelling error in uvlumcalib3.ws

- only need to mark the spectralon once in false-colour5.ws

- false-colour5.ws also makes the calibrated mono image

- false-colour5.ws now uses all spectralon patches to match UV / IR to vis

v4
==

- removed the reflectance standard step from visible calibration

- whitebalance is now optional -- a toggle turns correction on and off

- fixed a few small errors

v3
==

- calibrate3.ws now makes you select a reflectance standard and sets the
  brightness from that

  you need to enter the % reflectance of your standard -- it's 75% right now

- calibrate3.ws now automatically sets the depth of the output image to match
  the depth of the input (ie. 8- or 16-bit)

  the false-colour workspace did this in the previous version, now calibrate
  does it as well
